# hiPSC-derived_early_AxD_organoids
This code was used to analyze bulk RNAseq from early brain organoid data in the scope of the Alexander project. The data have been generated in two separate experiments. Experiment 1 included only organoids generated in Aggrewells. Experiment 2 included samples generated by two different approches, in Aggrewells and using direct-seeding method inspired by Lancaster et al. The goal was to perform differential gene expression analysis on Aggrewell (exp. 1) organoids and direct-seeding (exp. 2) organoids, and analysis of differences between the two approaches (exp. 2). The data have been deposited at GEO under accession number *?*.
